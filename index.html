						<h4>Bachelor of Engineering, Mechatronics</h4>
						<h2>McMaster University<br>Hamilton, ON </h2>
						<h2>Class of 2019</h2>
					</section><!--

					Description

					--><section class="col-3-5">
						<p>My education primarily focuses on software development and electronics, providing a flexible approach to solving problems. This allows me to tackle problems that both require the use of a physical system (ex. autonomous car) or don’t (ex. back-end data storage).<br>Some of my courses include: software development, operating systems, embedded systems design, dynamic models and control of physical systems, scientific computation, signals and systems.</p>

						<h4>Mechanical Engineering Intern</h4>
						<h2>Kirchhoff Automotive <br> North York, ON</h2>
						<h2>May - August 2017</h2>
					</section><!--

					Description

					--><section class="col-3-5">
						<p>While I learned a lot about manufacturing and process engineering in this position, the greatest skill I learned here was the ability to communicate with a wide range of people and coordinate their efforts to complete tasks. Kirchhoff Automotive was very diverse and open, and I was able to learn how to effectively communicate my ideas with both technical (ex. robotic technicians) and non-technical people (ex. accounting and sales managers). Through this, I was also able to learn how to coordinate their efforts in projects, which included holding meetings, scheduling tasks, and setting due dates.<br><br>Some projects I worked on: designed a quick die change procedure for a Chevrolet stamping die and decreased the time needed by 50%, resolved a robotic pin feeder problem by redesigning and implementing improved parts, utilized lean principles to design improved process layouts of production line equipment, calculated life-cycle cost assessments (ex. packaging cost) for high volume production parts.</p>

						<h4>Software Developer, Embedded Systems</h4>
						<h2>McMaster Formula Electric SAE <br> Hamilton, ON</h2>
						<h2>September 2016 - Current</h2>
					</section><!--

					Description

					--><section class="col-3-5">
						<p>I initially started in this club on the mechanical team, working to create steering wheel designs on SolidWorks and 3D printing prototypes. Now, I work on the software team, dealing with creating C programs for embedded systems. My current project utilizes an ATmega32M1 chip to interface with the race car’s CAN network and control fans through PWM. This will allow us to cool the race car while also varying fan speeds depending on temperature sensor readings, ultimately saving power. The plan for this team is to compete against other North American teams this summer, with the long-term goal of competing internationally in Europe.</p>

					</section><!--

					Description

					--><section class="col-3-5">
						<p>My position in this society deals with organizing and carrying out events for fellow students, particularly with other Mechatronics peers. From social events (ex. Boston Pizza Social) to professional events (ex. resume critique), I ensure that events are approved by university administration and that they run smoothly. I coordinate with fellow society members in weekly meetings where we discuss program issues and plan out future events. My next goal for this position is to introduce more social events, like movie night outings, to give everyone more chances to meet up and build relationships with their peers apart from just classes. I strongly believe that strong relationships with your peers are important for success in all aspects of life!</p>
